In the ever-evolving landscape of electronics, ensuring reliable protection for power supply circuits is paramount. Enter the **TCKE9 series**—an innovative line of **23V high input voltage Single Input-Single Output eFuse ICs**. Designed with versatility and robustness in mind, the TCKE9 series offers a range of protective features that make it a standout choice for a variety of applications.

## Key Features and Benefits

**1. Reusable Fuse with Advanced Protection:**  
The TCKE9 series is engineered to function as a reusable fuse, providing critical protection while maintaining long-term reliability. Its protection features include adjustable **over-current limits** set via an external resistor, **short-circuit protection**, and an **over-voltage clamp**. These features ensure that the circuit remains safeguarded against common electrical anomalies.

**2. Adjustable Slew Rate Control:**  
With the ability to adjust the slew rate control through an external capacitance, the TCKE9 series allows for fine-tuned management of the power supply's response. This is particularly useful in applications where precise control over the rate of voltage changes is essential.

**3. Customizable Under Voltage Protection:**  
One of the standout features of this series is its **adjustable under-voltage protection**, which can be tailored using an external resistor. This adaptability is crucial as voltage thresholds can vary greatly depending on the specific application, making this feature highly valuable for diverse scenarios.

**4. Thermal Shutdown:**  
To further enhance reliability, the TCKE9 series includes **thermal shutdown** capabilities. This feature ensures that the IC is protected from overheating, thus preventing potential damage or failure during operation.

**5. Compact and Efficient Design:**  
The TCKE9 series is available in a compact **0.5mm pitch WSON8 package** (2.0mm x 2.0mm, with a maximum thickness of 0.8mm). This small form factor makes it ideal for high-density soldering applications, such as those found in portable electronics.

**6. Low ON Resistance and High Output Current:**  
With a typical **ON resistance** of just 34 mΩ and a maximum output current capability of 4.0 A, the TCKE9 series offers both high efficiency and robust performance. This makes it particularly suitable for high-current applications, including USB VBUS lines, storage power supplies, and battery charging circuits.

## Personal Observations

From our perspective, the TCKE9 series is an excellent fit for protecting USB VBUS lines. The high input voltage and compact design ensure that it can handle the power demands and spatial constraints typical of USB applications. Moreover, the **adjustable built-in under-voltage protection** is a significant advantage. Given the variability in application requirements, having the flexibility to customize the under-voltage threshold is incredibly beneficial. This feature not only enhances the adaptability of the IC but also allows for precise protection tailored to specific needs.

In summary, the TCKE9 series is a versatile and robust solution for power supply protection. Its combination of advanced features, compact size, and customizable settings makes it a valuable asset for a wide range of electronic applications. Whether you're designing a portable device or managing a high-current power supply, the TCKE9 series offers the protection and efficiency needed to ensure reliable operation and longevity.
