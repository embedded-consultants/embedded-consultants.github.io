# Portfolio Overview

We specialize in consumer, industrial, and medical devices, providing end products and prototypes. Our expertise spans hardware, firmware, and custom software development. With a network of partners and contractors in manufacturing and software, we offer comprehensive project support.

#### Decade worth of hardware experience

Embedded Consultants heart is with hardware as we have a decade worth of experience doing it.

## Project Categories
#### IoT
IoT devices are everywhere nowadays and we have dipped our toes in those waters as well. 

For example we have built *Smart Home Controllers*, *Digital Twin System*, etc.
#### Industrial
Industrial devices are projects that require precise engineering as the requirements and the specific certifications are "next level". 

For example we have built *Robotic arm controllers*, *Power Supplies*, etc.
#### Modules 
Modules are used to get other products on the market as fast as possible. 

For example we have built *Power Supply Modules*, *ESP-32 Expanded Module*, *Medical grade tracking module* etc.

#### There is no firmware without hardware

MCU or MPU centered projects are very popular as they are cheap and easy to use. 

##### We have experience working with:
- STM8/STM32
- ESP8266/ESP32
- AVR (ATMEGA, ATTINY, ATSAMD)

#### Additional software solutions

Not all projects are without an external controller such as a PC, Android/iOS Phone, Tablets etc.. That is why we are also offering *additional software solutions* which include:

- Static Website Development
- Dashboard/Monitoring Website Development
- iOS/Android App Development
- Backend/Server Development
- 3D Ecosystem Development

#### Everything else next to hardware
Just as the below picture shows, anything can be built, but it depends... on many factors!
